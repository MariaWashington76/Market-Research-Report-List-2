<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct-To-Chip Liquid Cold Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-phase</li><li>Dual-phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Direct-To-Chip Liquid Cold Plate market is categorized into two types: single-phase and dual-phase cooling systems. Single-phase systems utilize a liquid coolant that remains in a liquid state throughout the cooling process, effectively transferring heat away from the chip to maintain optimal temperatures. In contrast, dual-phase systems leverage both liquid and vapor phases, enabling more efficient heat transfer as the coolant evaporates and condenses, allowing for greater thermal management in high-performance applications.</p></p>
